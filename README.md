The application allows users to search through a collection of NBA Players that played in the 2021-2022 NBA season which is stored in the CSV format. Users can look up a player directly through their stats. The application will also check whether the NBA player stats exist or not. In addition, the names of all the players can be searched by their first name and last name.  The search can be further refined by stat. The application is based on multiple RBT trees mapping the values of name, pts, rebs, steals, blocks, assists. To allow searching through names and stats, the RBT also supports iterating through all the NBAPlayer (values) in the multiple trees.

To run this code, download all folders into a file, compile, and run NBAPlayerMapper
